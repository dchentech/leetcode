Question:
    Invert Binary Tree

    Invert a binary tree.

         4
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   / \
    1   3 6   9
    to
         4
       /   \
      7     2
     / \   / \
    9   6 3   1

    Trivia:
    This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
    Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.
